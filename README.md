A menu for a restaurant. Practice on Bootstrap 5 grid system and small Js features. <br>
Only the first submenu is finished since the Menu is really long. I could finish this to show in a future porfolio. <br>
For future improvements I learn how to store all the pictures in a database like Firebase and request the pictures from there instead of storage
Does that make the page slower?
